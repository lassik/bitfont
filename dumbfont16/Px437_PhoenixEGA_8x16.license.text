This dumbfont file has been machine-extracted from a TTF file in The
Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack v1.0 // 2016-01-16. The font pack is

    I do not claim any rights to the original raster fonts on which
    this work is based. Credit for these goes to their respective
    designers.

    The font files in this pack (TTF and FON remakes and enhancements)

So the font is recreated from the video memory of an old computer,
making it abandonware, but may have been retouched by VileR.
